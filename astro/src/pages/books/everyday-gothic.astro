                    Itâ€™s there in your walk home, creeping into your everyday
                    life. A gothic feeling. In the strangers who look at you
                    like they know you. In the empty field outside of town and
                    the Chinese restaurant down the street and the strange red
                    light in the distance that never stops flashing. >
                </p>
                <p>A sense of something you cannot name.</p>

                    Everyday Gothic plays on the traditions of gothic
                    literature, examining daily life through a gothic lens.
                    Sometimes satirical and sometimes serious, the resulting
                    snapshots are available on <a
                        href="https://everydaygothic.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a
