                    Welcome to the Lady Lighthouse Keepers project. Within this
                    project, I am uniting my love of history, feminism, and
                    lonely lighthouses on far off seas. As with many professions
                    throughout history, the majority of lighthouse keepers were
                    men. But what about the minority?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many women throughout the 1700s, 1800s, and 1900s operated
                    lighthouses. Often, they took the role after their husband
                    or father died and managed until another man could be hired,
                    but other women became lighthouse keepers on their own,
                    holding down what was an intensely demanding job, both
                    mentally and physically.
                </p>
                <p>These are their stories.</p>
                <p>

                        I am undertaking research into the individual women who
                        kept watch at Americaâ€™s lighthouses and the way of life
                        they built. All of my research will be available here on
                        the blog, and you can also follow me on Instagram,
                        Twitter, or Facebook for updates.
