    <p>
        Jules Harter is a purveyor of stories and aspiring hermit. She is the 
        author of <i>The Last Lighthouse Keeper</i>, a gothic romance. Jules also 
        writes contemporary and historical novels that feature out-of-their-depth 
        characters, LGBTQ casts, a hint of romance, and settings tnat are just a bit 
        gothic.
    </p>
    <p>
        Jules is traveler, seeking and offering stories wherever she finds 
        herself. At any given time, you might catch her living in a small 
        cottage in the woods or on a windswept island in the shadow of an 
        abandoned lighthouse. Or boarding a train and seeing where it takes her. 
        Whichever. She isnâ€™t particular.
    </p>
    <p>
        Jules also hopes to bring back the trend of <a href="/hire-a-hermit">
        ornamental hermits</a>. If you have a large estate, mountain cave, or 
        desert island that could benefit from a hermit (or anything else you 
        would like to share with her), <a href="/contact">send her an email</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you prefer to hear her shouting into the void, follow her on your 
        preferred social media platform.
